              <p>Handmade Hero is an ongoing project to create a complete, 
                  professional-quality game accompanied by videos that explain every single
                   line of its source code(<a href="https://handmadehero.org/"> HandMade Hero</a>).

            <p>I just put what I have learned everyday here . 
                 I would much appreciate for it if you could help me to make the notes better.
                This just covers something that I don't understand and I may forget. 
                So the notes might be not full coverd everything the course teaches.

            <h3 class="text-center">Codes</h3>
            <p>Unlike what Casey did, I just use the Visual Studio to code and compile. If you want to do just as what he did , 
                maybe you need a little extra work. And if you are not familiar with Emacs, I recommend you to use VS Code.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Source control</h3>
            <p>I would put every day's source code on Github. And you could find the history version in history
                 Folder.It's just for reference use. I strongly recommend you to purchase it from <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">HandMade Hero </a>
                 to get the latest code and support the author.</p>
