            <blockquote>
              <p>Handmade Hero is an ongoing project to create a complete, 
                  professional-quality game accompanied by videos that explain every single
                   line of its source code(<a href="https://handmadehero.org/"> HandMade Hero</a>). 
                   And this is my version of this project. Most code are the same. 
                   I will try to take notes with different topics. Hope that this can help you.</p>

            <p>I just put what I have learned everyday here . I also use the OneNote to take notes. 
                For me it's much more easier to use rather than Markdown. So if you are interested in this, you can use <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ag84ICr6dwOR1V8KYzTexywCoYpq">this link</a>  to take notes with me.
                 I would much appreciate for it.
                    This just covers something that I don't understand and I may forget. 
                    So the notes might be not full coverd everything the course teaches.

            <h3 class="text-center">Codes</h3>
            <p>Unlike what Casey did, I just use the Visual Studio to code and compile. If you want to do just as him , 
                maybe you need a little extra work. And if you are not familiar with Emacs, I recommend you to use VS Code.</p>

            <p>I would put every day's source code on Github. And you could find the history version in History
                 Folder.It's just for reference use. I strongly recommend you to purchase it from <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">HandMade Hero </a>
                 to get the latest code and support the author.</p>
