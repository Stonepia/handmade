This is just a personally Notebook of HandMade Hero Project.I will try to illustrate what I have learned concretely.
I am really hoping to find more people who can help me to make this note more complete.

**Docs** are collections of pages in docs/_docs folder. They are typically organized by different topics and basically follows the timeline.

**Blogs** are some fragmented topics. The blogs posts are just organized by timestamp.

You can also find history source file in `history` folder.

#### Others
While Debugging, you may add some parameters or arguments in `Watch` Window.This can help you to get some useful information. In Viusal Studio 2017 ,when you toggled a breakpoint, you may also find useful information at the end of each line.  

You may also find that it's useful to keep track of the `Autos` Window. 


## Starting a Project
If you want to just build a project using Visual Studio. You can create a project by New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Empty Project.  

As for `includes`  or `build.bat` ,you may edit it from **Solution Explorer**'s property.
